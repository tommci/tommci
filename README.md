### Bachelor of Computer Science at Colorado School of Mines

I'm currently a 3rd year at Mines, with a focus in Computer Engineering. Programming is not only part of my studies, but is also a hobby that I enjoy doing and researching on a frequent basis.
Take a look at some of my public repos for projects I'm working on! Some are for my classes at Mines, and some are personal. Any school project repositories will have "csci" at the start of their name.
