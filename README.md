# Hey, I'm Thomas :black_cat:
### <sub> Also known as Thom </sub>
### I'm a Bachelor of Computer Science at [Colorado School of Mines](https://cs.mines.edu/)

- This is my 3rd year at Mines, with a focus in Computer Engineering. I want to know all I can about computers and how they work!
- Currently looking for internship roles in Software Engineering, Developing, or Hardware Engineering.
- I have a special interest in VR/AR tech, and have been considering some projects involving them.
- Programming is not only part of my studies, but is also a hobby that I enjoy doing and researching on a frequent basis.
- Many of my projects are public here within my repos. Take a look! Some are for my classes at Mines, and some are personal. Any school project repositories will have "csci" at the start of their name.
